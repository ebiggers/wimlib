  linux/include/linux/rbtree.h

  To use rbtrees you'll have to implement your own insert and search cores.
  This will avoid us to use callbacks and to drop drammatically performances.
  I know it's not the cleaner way,  but in C (not in C++) to get
  performances and genericity...

  See Documentation/rbtree.txt for documentation and samples.
