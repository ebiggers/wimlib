.TH WIMEXTRACT "1" "February 2024" "wimlib 1.14.4" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
wimextract \- Extract files from a WIM image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwimextract\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR \fIIMAGE\fR [(\fIPATH\fR | @\fILISTFILE\fR)...]  [\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwimextract\fR, or equivalently \fBwimlib-imagex extract\fR, extracts one or
more files or directory trees from the specified \fIIMAGE\fR contained in the
Windows Imaging (WIM) archive \fIWIMFILE\fR.
.PP
\fBwimextract\fR is intended for extracting only a subset of a WIM image.  If
you want to extract or "apply" a full WIM image to a directory or NTFS volume,
use \fBwimapply\fR(1) instead.
.PP
\fIIMAGE\fR specifies the image in \fIWIMFILE\fR from which to extract the files
or directory trees.  It may be the 1-based index of an image or the name of an
image.  It may be omitted if \fIWIMFILE\fR contains only one image.  You can use
\fBwiminfo\fR(1) to list the images contained in \fIWIMFILE\fR.
.PP
If no additional arguments are given, the entire WIM image is extracted.
Otherwise, each additional argument is interpreted as a \fIPATH\fR if it does
not begin with the '@' character, or a \fILISTFILE\fR if it does.  Each
\fIPATH\fR specifies a file or directory tree within the WIM image to extract,
whereas each \fILISTFILE\fR specifies a file that itself contains a list of
paths to extract.  If a \fILISTFILE\fR is "-" (i.e. the whole argument is "@-"),
then the listfile is read from standard input.  See \fBPATHS AND LISTFILES\fR
for more details.
.PP
By default, files and directories are extracted to the current directory.  Use
\fB--dest-dir\fR to select a different destination directory.  Alternatively,
use \fB--to-stdout\fR to extract a file to standard output to pipe into another
program.
.PP
A file or directory extracted from a \fIPATH\fR argument is by default extracted
directly into the destination directory, whereas a file or directory extracted
from a \fILISTFILE\fR argument is by default extracted into the destination
directory in such a way that the archive's directory structure is
preserved.  Use \fB--preserve-dir-structure\fR to always get the latter
behavior.
.PP
\fBwimextract\fR supports extracting files and directory trees from stand-alone
WIMs as well as split WIMs.  See \fBSPLIT WIMS\fR.
.SH PATHS AND LISTFILES
Each path, including those on the command line and those in listfiles, must be
specified as an absolute path starting from the root of the WIM image, like
those output by \fBwimdir\fR(1).  However, path separators may be either forward
or backward slashes, and the leading slash is optional.
.PP
On Windows, by default paths are treated case-insensitively, whereas on
UNIX-like systems, by default paths are treated case-sensitively.  In either
case, the default behavior may be overridden through the
\fBWIMLIB_IMAGEX_IGNORE_CASE\fR environmental variable, as documented in
\fBwimlib-imagex\fR(1).
.PP
By default, each path may contain the wildcard characters '?' and '*'.  The '?'
character matches any non-path-separator character, whereas the '*' character
matches zero or more non-path-separator characters.  Consequently, a single
wildcard path, or "glob", may expand to multiple actual files or directories.
Use the \fB--no-globs\fR option to disable wildcard matching and search for each
path literally.
.PP
Each \fILISTFILE\fR must be a text file (UTF-8 or UTF-16LE encoded; plain ASCII
is also fine) that
contains a list of paths to extract, one per line.  Wildcard characters are
allowed by default.  The following demonstrates an example listfile:
.PP
.RS
.nf

; This is a comment (begins with semicolon)
# This is also a comment (begins with number sign)
/Users
/Windows/explorer.exe
/Windows/System32/en-US/*

; Both forward and backslashes are valid.
; It's not necessary to quote paths containing internal spaces.
\\Program Files\\A*

; Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored
    \\Windows\\notepad*

.SH SPLIT WIMS
You may use \fBwimextract\fR to extract files or directory trees from a split
WIM.  This uses the \fB--refs\fR="\fIGLOB\fR" option in the same way as in other
commands such as \fBwimapply\fR.  See \fBwimapply\fR(1) for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
Before extracting the files, verify the integrity of \fIWIMFILE\fR if it
contains extra integrity information.
.TP
\fB--ref\fR="\fIGLOB\fR"
File glob of additional WIMs or split WIM parts to reference resources from.
See \fBSPLIT_WIMS\fR.  Note: \fIGLOB\fR is listed in quotes because it is
interpreted by \fBwimextract\fR and may need to be quoted to protect against
shell expansion.
.TP
\fB--dest-dir\fR=\fIDIR\fR
Extract the files and directories to the directory \fIDIR\fR instead of to the
current working directory.
.TP
\fB--to-stdout\fR
Extract the files to standard output instead of to the filesystem.  This can
only be provided if all the specified paths are to regular files (not
directories or reparse points).  If present, named data streams are not
extracted.
.TP
\fB--unix-data\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--no-acls\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--strict-acls\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--no-attributes\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--include-invalid-names\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--no-globs\fR
Do not recognize wildcard characters in paths.  Each path will be searched for
literally.  In addition, if case insensitivity is enabled, do not allow a single
path to match multiple files with the same case-insensitive name but different
case-sensitive names.
.IP
\fB--no-wildcards\fR is also accepted as an alias for this option.
.TP
\fB--nullglob\fR
If a glob does not match any files, ignore it and print a warning instead of
failing with an error.  In other words, this option allows a glob to
successfully match zero files.
.IP
This option also affects paths that do not contain wildcard characters, since
such paths are still considered globs unless \fB--no-globs\fR is enabled.  If
case-insensitivity is enabled, such a glob could match multiple files with the
same case-insensitive name but different case-sensitive names, whereas a
non-glob path (with \fB--no-globs\fR) can match at most one file.
.TP
\fB--preserve-dir-structure\fR
When extracting paths, preserve the archive directory structure instead of
extracting the file or directory tree named by each path directly to the
destination directory.  Note: \fB--preserve-dir-structure\fR is already the
default behavior for paths in listfiles, but not paths directly specified on the
command line.
.TP
\fB--wimboot\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--compact\fR=\fIFORMAT\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.TP
\fB--recover-data\fR
See the documentation for this option to \fBwimapply\fR(1).
.SH NOTES
See \fBwimapply\fR(1) for information about what data and metadata are extracted
on UNIX-like systems versus on Windows.
.PP
Reparse-point fixups (a.k.a. changing absolute symbolic links and junctions to
point within the extraction location) are never done by \fBwimextract\fR.
Use \fBwimapply\fR if you want this behavior.
.PP
Unlike \fBwimapply\fR, \fBwimextract\fR does not support extracting files
directly to an NTFS volume using libntfs-3g.
