/* Describe how to deal with options that follow non-option ARGV-elements.

   If the caller did not specify anything,
   the default is REQUIRE_ORDER if the environment variable
   POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, PERMUTE otherwise.

   REQUIRE_ORDER means don't recognize them as options;
   stop option processing when the first non-option is seen.
   This is what Unix does.
   This mode of operation is selected by either setting the environment
   variable POSIXLY_CORRECT, or using `+' as the first character
   of the list of option characters.

   PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of ARGV as we scan,
   so that eventually all the non-options are at the end.  This allows options
   to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to
   expect this.

   RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written
   to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care about
   the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element
   as if it were the argument of an option with character code 1.
   Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters
   selects this mode of operation.

   The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
   of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only
   `--' can cause `getopt' to return -1 with `woptind' != ARGC.  */

/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `woptind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns -1.
   Then `woptind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `wopterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `woptarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `woptarg', otherwise `woptarg' is set to zero.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.

   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
   if the `flag' field is zero.

   The elements of ARGV aren't really const, because we permute them.
   But we pretend they're const in the prototype to be compatible
   with other systems.

   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct woption' terminated by an
   element containing a name which is zero.

   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
   recent call.

   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
   long-named options.  */
